<p>
    The Simpsons is an American animated television sitcom created by Matt Groening and produced by the Fox Broadcasting
    Company. The main characters are a satire of a working class family, consisting of lazy family father, Homer, hard
    working stay-at-home mother, Marge and their three children, troublemaker, Bart, charismatic Lisa, and
    pacifier-sucking Maggie. The series lampoons many aspects of American culture, history, politics, and society.

<h2 id="Homer" class="sims">Homer Simpsons</h2>

<p>
    Homer Jay Simpson, formerly known as Max Power, is the father of the Simpson family. He is overweight, lazy, and
    ignorant, but also strongly devoted to his wife and children. He works as a low level safety inspector at the
    Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, in Sector 7G, although he's often incompetent, mostly sleeps on duty and eats the
    donuts provided. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his lifelong friends Barney, Carl, Lenny,
    and bartender Moe Szyslak. At home he can often be found sitting on the sofa mindlessly watching TV while snacking
    on food and drinking Duff beer.

<h2 id="Marge" class="sims">Marge Simpsons</h2>

<p>
    Marjorie "Marge" B. Simpson, (n√©e Bouvier; born March 19), is the happy homemaker and full-time mom of the
    Simpson family. With her husband Homer, she has three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie Simpson. Marge is the
    moralistic force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to
    maintain order in the Simpson household. Aside from her duties at home, Marge flirted briefly with a number of
    careers ranging from police officer to anti-violence activist.

<h2 id="Bart" class="sims">Bart Simpsons</h2>

<p>
    Bartholomew JoJo Simpson is a fictional character in the American animated television series The Simpsons and part
    of
    the Simpson family. He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright and first appeared on television in The Tracey Ullman Show
    short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed Bart while waiting in the lobby
    of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip, Life in
    Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of characters. While the rest of the characters were named after
    Groening's family members, Bart's name is an anagram of the word brat. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for
    two years, the Simpson family received its own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989. Bart has appeared in
    every Simpsons episode except "Four Great Women and a Manicure".

<h2 id="Lisa" class="sims">Lisa Simpsons</h2>

<p>
    Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9) is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement level
    of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she's also the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa
    lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies like playing saxophone and guitar, riding and
    caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity's affected by those who view her
    as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. Lisa Simpson's a smart, witty, independent girl
    who focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at age 8 she's already a member of MENSA with an IQ
    of 159.

<h2 id="Maggie" class="sims">Maggie Simpsons</h2>

<p>
    Margaret Lenny "Maggie" Simpson is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. She is
    almost always seen sucking on her pacifier and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her face.
    Because she cannot walk or talk, Maggie is the least seen in the Simpson family.
